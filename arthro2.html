    It’s about time!! We’re more than excited to announce that we’ll be heading back to Australia and New Zealand in October. It’s been over six years since we last visited Australia and nine years since we were lucky enough to set foot in New Zealand... we’re long overdue!

    This trip represents another new adventure for us during the WorldWired tour; it will be the first time we have ever headlined stadiums in Australia and New Zealand. To help us celebrate, our friends in Slipknot will be joining us for the journey.

    All the perks of the current WorldWired Tour will be in place starting with the Wherever I May Roam Black Ticket we introduced a year ago in North America; just one ticket will allow floor access to any Metallica show in this part of the world. Black Ticket holders need only choose the show(s) they would like to attend and make an online reservation no less than 48 hours before the gig. A limited number of these Black Tickets* will be available for $598 AUD through CID Entertainment.

    As with most of the WorldWired shows, every ticket purchased includes a choice of a standard physical or standard digital copy of Hardwired…To Self-Destruct.** And once again, all tickets will include a free MP3 download of the show(s) attended, mixed and mastered by the team behind Hardwired. The free full-show downloads can be obtained by scanning or entering the barcode from that show’s ticket stub at LiveMetallica.com/scan.

    Last but not least, the Enhanced Experience options will be available with three choices of special packages, including premium tickets and amenities ranging from early access to the venue and the "Memory Remains" traveling museum to meeting members of the band. Visit CID Entertainment for full package details.

    Fan Club presales begin Tuesday, March 12th at 1 PM local time... click here for details.

    A complete list of other presales can be found here.

    Tickets go on sale to the general public Monday, March 18th at 2 PM local time for all cities except Sydney, where the sale begins at 3 PM local time.
